Repository for __Wisej - Full Stack Web Development__ examples.

__Wisej__ is designed to build, debug, deploy and manage web applications of any complexity in Visual Studio or SharpDevelop. It’s a highly specialized framework for Real Time Web Applications. Developers can focus on their projects and don’t worry about HTML, state management, backend services, callbacks, ajax panels, synchronization, DOM, CSS, JavaScript, security, authentication, concurrency...

This repository groups the content of all examples found on [Wisej site](https://wisej.com/examples/), some examples found on [Wisej Blogs](https://wisej.com/category/blog/) and also some new examples.

Developers new to Wisej should install [Wisej trial version](https://wisej.com/#buy).

Each example is self contained and includes all Wisej extensions needed to run out-of-the-box.
